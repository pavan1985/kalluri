With the VM-Series, you can quickly create a hybrid architecture that extends your existing datacenter onto AWS via an IPsec VPN tunnel. As your AWS deployment grows, application whitelisting and segmentation policies can be implemented to maintain compliance and improve your security posture by preventing cyberattacks from moving laterally from VPC-to-VPC and subnet-to-subnet. Full integration with AWS Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) ensures that workloads are always protected as they scale dynamically. Auto Scaling for the VM-Series on AWS uses a combination of AWS services (AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudWatch, S3, SNS) and PAN-OS/VM-Series automation features (API, bootstrapping). Native management features can automate the firewall deployment and policy updates while Panorama (purchased separately) allows the VM-Series to be managed centrally alongside our firewall appliances to maintain security policy consistency.
